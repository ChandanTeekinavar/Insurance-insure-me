This is an Insurance Domain Project named insure-me. 

In this project I have used Following tools:-

Git - For version control for tracking changes in the code files
Jenkins - For continuous integration and continuous deployment
Docker - For deploying containerized applications
Ansible - Configuration management tools
Selenium - For automating tests on the deployed web application
AWS : For creating ec2 machines as servers and deploy the web application.



In order to run the application use port 8081..
